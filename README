paste2keyboard
==============

This program sends all unicode chars from a file to a virtual keyboard.
This can be usefull for fuzzing/trying to inject heavy user application.

The viirtualkeyboard uses the SendInput[1] function to simulate the keyboard events.
Only hardware, not virtual, key codes are used.
